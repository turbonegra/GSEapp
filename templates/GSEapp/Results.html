    Yor decision was {{player.choice}}. There were other {{player.size_group}} people that chose {{player.choice}} in you group. Therefore your earnings
    are {{player.payoff|floatformat:"0"}} points.
</p>
<p> The conversion rate from points to Euros is {{rate|floatformat:"2"}} points = 1 EUR. You have earned {{player.payment}} Euros that will be given to
you only if you finish the following waves.

    This wave of the experiment has finished. Thank you very much for making it possible. See you soon in the next wave.
